# Interview Scheduler

Interview Scheduler is an extremely useful app for booking appointments with interviewers! 

Prospective interviewees can see how many available spots are left for each day of the week just by looking at the sidebar! After selecting a day, users will be greeted with time blocks showing either an "+" icon indicating an avilable spot or an occupied booking which will display the student's name and interviewer they booked the appointment with. Occupied spots can be edited (to change the name or interviewer) or deleted (to cancel an appointment). But don't worry before a cancellation can take place the app will confirm with the user so no mishaps take place!

Some additional functionalities include not being able to book an appointment without typing a name in the input field and appropriate error messages if anything goes wrong with a booking or cancellation.

With Interview Scheduler both students and interviewers can rest assure appointment booking will be a smooth process!
